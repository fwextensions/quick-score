> `quick-score` is a JavaScript string-scoring and fuzzy-matching library based on the Quicksilver algorithm, and is ideal for interactive matching as a user types a query.

QuickScore improves on the original Quicksilver algorithm by tuning the scoring for long strings, such as webpage titles or URLs, so that the order of the search results makes more sense.  It's used by the [QuicKey extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quickey-%E2%80%93-the-quick-tab-s/ldlghkoiihaelfnggonhjnfiabmaficg) to enable users to quickly search through their open tabs.

QuickScore is fast, dependency-free, and is only 2.5KB when minified and gzipped.


## Demo

[See QuickScore in action](https://fwextensions.github.io/quick-score-demo/), and compare its results to other scoring and matching libraries.


## Install

```sh
npm install --save quick-score
```


## Usage

### Calling `quickScore()` directly

You can import the `quickScore()` function from the ES6 module:

```js
import {quickScore} from "quick-score";
```

Or from a property of the CommonJS module:

```js
const quickScore = require("quick-score").quickScore;
```

You can then call `quickScore()` with a `string` and a `query` to score against that string.  It will return a floating point score between `0` and `1`.  A higher score means that string is a better match for the query.  A `1` means the query is the highest match for the string, though the two strings may still differ in case and whitespace characters.

```js
quickScore("thought", "gh");   // 0.7000000000000001
quickScore("GitHub", "gh");    // 0.9166666666666666
```

Matching `gh` against `GitHub` returns a higher score than `thought`, because it matches the capital letters in `GitHub`, which are weighted more highly.


### Sorting lists of strings with a `QuickScore` instance

A common use-case is sorting and filtering lists of items in real time as the user types a query.  Instead of calling `quickScore()` directly for every item in the list and then sorting, it's simpler to use an instance of the `QuickScore` class:

```js
import {QuickScore} from "quick-score";

const qs = new QuickScore(["thought", "giraffe", "GitHub", "hello, Garth"]);
const results = qs.search("gh");

//=>
[
    {
        "item": "GitHub",
        "score": 0.9166666666666666,
        "matches": [[0, 1], [3, 4]]
    },
    {
        "item": "hello, Garth",
        "score": 0.6263888888888888,
        "matches": [[7, 8], [11, 12]]
    },
    ...
```

The `results` array is a list of objects that represent the results of matching the query against each string that was passed to the constructor.  It's sorted high to low on each item's score.  Strings with identical scores are sorted alphabetically and case-insensitively.  In the simple case of scoring bare strings, each item has three properties:

* `item`: the string that was scored
* `score`: the floating point score of the string for the current query
* `matches`: an array of arrays that specifies the character ranges where the query matched the string

This array could then be used to render a list of matching results as the user types a query.  By default, items with scores of zero are returned in the array.


### Sorting lists of objects

Typically, you'll be sorting items more complex than a bare string.  To tell QuickScore which of an object's keys to score a query against, pass an array of keys as the second parameter to the `QuickScore()` constructor:

```js
const bookmarks = [
    {
        "title": "lodash documentation",
        "url": "https://lodash.com/docs"
    },
    {
        "title": "Supplying Images - Google Chrome",
        "url": "developer.chrome.com/webstore/images"
    },
    ...
];
const qs = new QuickScore(bookmarks, ["title", "url"]);
const results = qs.search("devel");

//=>
[
    {
        "item": {
            "title": "Supplying Images - Google Chrome",
            "url": "developer.chrome.com/webstore/images"
        },
        "scores": {
            "title": 0,
            "url": 0.9138888888888891
        },
        "matches": {
            "title": [],
            "url": [[0, 5]]
        },
        "score": 0.9138888888888891,
        "scoreKey": "url"
    },
    ...
```

Each item in the results array has a few more properties when matching against objects:

* `item`: the object that was scored
* `score`: the highest score from among the individual key scores
* `scoreKey`: the name of the key with the highest score, which will be an empty string if they're all zero
* `scores`: a hash of the individual scores for each key
* `matches`: a hash of arrays that specify the character ranges of the query match for each key

When two items have the same score, they're sorted alphabetically and case-insensitively on the first key in the keys array.  In the example above, that would be `title`.


### Highlighting matched letters

Many search interfaces highlight the letters in each item that match what the user has typed.  The `matches` property of each item in the results array contains information that can be used to highlight those matching letters.

This function is an example of how an item could be highlighted using React.  It surrounds each sequence of matching letters in a `<mark>` tag and then returns the full string in a `<span>`.  You could then style the `<mark>` tag to be bold or a different color to highlight the matches.  (Something similar could be done by concatenating plain strings of HTML tags, though you'll need to be careful to escape the substrings.)

```jsx
function highglight(string, matches) {
    const substrings = [];
    let previousEnd = 0;

    for (let [start, end] of matches) {
        const prefix = string.substring(previousEnd, start);
        const match = <mark>{string.substring(start, end)}</mark>;

        substrings.push(prefix, match);
        previousEnd = end;
    }

    substrings.push(string.substring(previousEnd));

    return <span>{React.Children.toArray(substrings)}</span>;
}
```


## API

See the [API docs](https://fwextensions.github.io/quick-score/) for a full description of the [QuickScore class](https://fwextensions.github.io/quick-score/QuickScore.html) and the [quickScore function](https://fwextensions.github.io/quick-score/global.html#quickScore).


<!--
## Algorithm

returns highest score, because averaging usually doesn't make sense

setItems()
setKeys()
doesn't modify items array

algorithm discounts sparse matches, matches later in the string, very long strings
always case-insensitive, uses `toLocaleLowerCase()`

searching `jqu` shows all the jquery results in QS, but fuzzy matches push others down in the Fuse results
searching `real` shows relevant "realtime" QS results, but crazy Fuse results.  RethinkDB is 5 pages down
or `reake` shows react key down on second page
fuse search `jqz` doesn't put jQuery Zoom first, matches against a random z in param
`libr` when using Quicksilver algo doesn't list a lot of library items at the top
accidentally typing `zom` instead of `zoom` still puts `jQuery Zoom` at the top with QuickScore, but fuzzysort matches `phonegap.com`, since the letters are in the long token at the end
lowering the threshold reduces some of the noise, but then may miss reasonable matches
QuicKey doesn't notice recently opened tabs?
stop rescoring on every render, memoize may work now
enable per-key configs

use localeCompare() to sort same scored strings
also for matching the query?
don't require new?
function FunkyParser (opt) {
  // hide "new"
  if (!(this instanceof FunkyParser))
    return new FunkyParser(opt)
  opt = opt || {}
}
